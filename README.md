# Hello, I'm Daniel Tambon ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineering student at UCSAL, expected to graduate in June 2028. I have a solid technical foundation, strengthened by four semesters in Computer Engineering at UFBA, which broadened my interdisciplinary perspective on technology.

Currently, I work as an intern at SERPRO (Federal Data Processing Service), where I contribute to requirements analysis, development, prototyping, and client support. I was selected in two competitive recruitment processes, including a practical exam where I delivered a complete full-stack solution.

I am also a student at Infinity School, an international technology and digital arts school, with expected completion in October 2025. There, I developed projects involving artificial intelligence and earned the top 1 position among more than 500 students.

Additionally, I work on freelance web development projects, such as institutional websites for law firms, always focusing on practical and efficient solutions.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you'd like to connect or learn more!
